const integrationAPI = require('./QUICK_IMPLEMENTATION.js');
```

### **Step 2: Restart Your Server**

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: "Failed to load integrations"**
**Solution:** You need to add the API endpoints to `server.js` (see Step 1 above)

### **Problem: "Cannot POST /api/integrations"**
**Solution:** The API endpoints aren't added yet. Add the code from `QUICK_IMPLEMENTATION.js`

### **Problem: Integration created but not showing**
**Solution:** Refresh the page or check the browser console for errors

### **Problem: Want to see sample data**
**Solution:** Create a test integration with fake data to see how it works
