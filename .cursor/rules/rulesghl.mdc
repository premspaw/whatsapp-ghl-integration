Complete rules & implementation plan ‚Äî Options A & B (AI with memory, training, GHL data access) üéØ

Nice ‚Äî you‚Äôre building a proper platform. Below I give a single, thorough blueprint you can drop into Cursor: architecture, DB schema, data flows, AI memory/RAG training, GHL mapping (tags/tasks/pipelines), automations, security, and exactly what Cursor will need from you (Supabase info, API keys, webhooks). I won‚Äôt ask questions ‚Äî I‚Äôll assume you own GHL API keys, a WhatsApp provider, and can create a Supabase project.

1 ‚Äî High-level choices (quick recap)

Option A: ‚ÄúCustom WhatsApp channel‚Äù ‚Äî post messages to GHL as channel: "whatsapp" if GHL has native WhatsApp enabled for your account, otherwise use channel: "sms" with meta.source=whatsapp. Clean separation, recommended.

Option B: ‚ÄúHijack SMS‚Äù ‚Äî intercept GHL outgoing SMS events and send via WhatsApp; post inbound messages as channel: "sms". Easier to make automations work unchanged but mixes analytics.

I‚Äôll give unified rules that work for both, with clear differences flagged.

2 ‚Äî Architecture overview (components)

Webhook / API Gateway (Node/Express server) ‚Äî receives:

WhatsApp provider callbacks (inbound messages, media).

GHL outbound webhooks (send-message triggers, contact updates).

Core services (modular):

ghlService ‚Äî wrappers: fetch contacts, tags, tasks, opportunities, pipeline stage, push messages, create contact.

whatsappService ‚Äî send/receive via chosen WhatsApp provider (Meta Cloud API, 360Dialog, UltraMsg).

aiService ‚Äî RAG + memory + model orchestration (OpenAI/DeepSeek or self-hosted).

syncService ‚Äî reconciles GHL ‚Üî DB ‚Üî WhatsApp.

Database ‚Äî Supabase (Postgres + vector extension) or Postgres + a vector DB. Supabase is recommended inside Cursor.

Embeddings store / Vector DB ‚Äî use Supabase vector extension or Pinecone/Weaviate.

Automation engine ‚Äî use n8n or internal worker for complex flows.

Frontend (optional) ‚Äî admin dashboard (React/Tailwind) to view messages, train data, and see AI suggestions.

Background jobs / queue ‚Äî for heavy tasks (embedding generation, training jobs, retries).

Logging & monitoring (Sentry, Prometheus).

3 ‚Äî Data model / Supabase schema (recommended)

Use Postgres tables; vector table for embeddings.

Tables (column highlights)

contacts

id (uuid), phone, ghl_contact_id, name, metadata (jsonb), last_seen_at, created_at

conversations

id (uuid), contact_id, ghl_location_id, channel (whatsapp|sms|email), last_message_at

messages

id, conversation_id, contact_id, direction (INCOMING|OUTGOING), provider_message_id, content, media[], meta jsonb (e.g., {source: "whatsapp"}), created_at, delivered_at

ai_conversation_memory (short-term)

id, conversation_id, message_id, role (user|assistant|system), text, tokens, created_at

ai_embeddings (vector)

id, conversation_id (nullable), source_type (webpage|doc|manual_note|ghl_task), source_id, text, embedding vector, chunk_meta jsonb, created_at

training_sources

id, type (website/page/doc), url, last_crawled_at, status

users (team users)

id, name, email, role, api_key

events_queue (for retries)

id, type, payload jsonb, attempts, next_attempt_at

ai_models (model config)

id, provider, model_name, temperature, system_prompt_template

Note: Supabase provides row-level security and JWT auth; store service keys in Cursor env vars, not in client code.

4 ‚Äî AI design: Memory + RAG + Training
Core idea

Short-term memory = recent last N messages (conversation window).

Long-term memory = vectorized facts about user: contact tags, tasks, pipeline stage, opportunities, previous decisions, custom FAQs, website docs.

RAG: at query time, retrieve relevant embeddings (contact-specific > org-wide docs > website pages) and inject into prompt.

Workflow (on incoming message)

Receive message ‚Üí store in messages.

Append to ai_conversation_memory.

Build context:

Pull last 6-12 messages (short-term memory).

Pull relevant embeddings: retrieve top-K from ai_embeddings filtered by contact_id or tags (vector similarity).

Pull GHL metadata for contact: tags, open tasks, active opportunities/pipeline stage, custom fields.

Construct prompt:

System prompt: you are an assistant for company X, use friendly tone, refer to contact by name, follow policies.

Context section: structured JSON summary of GHL data (tags, tasks, pipeline stage).

Retriever documents: top N retrieved docs (each chunk labeled).

Conversation history.

User query (latest message).

Call model (completion/chat) with RAG context. Optionally use retrieval-augmented LLM chain (if provider supports).

Post-process response: check for action intent (create task, book appointment, transfer to human).

Send reply via whatsappService (or via pushing to GHL and letting GHL UI handle it, depending on Option A/B).

Store assistant reply in messages and ai_conversation_memory.

Memory TTL & retention

Keep short-term memory ‚âà last 30 messages (or last 7 days).

Longer term facts: save explicit facts into ai_embeddings (e.g., ‚ÄúContact prefers emails on weekends‚Äù) ‚Äî persists.

Fine-tuning vs RAG

RAG + prompt engineering is primary. Train/customize with:

Company docs, FAQs, website pages, past conversation logs ‚Üí chunk + embed ‚Üí index.

Use fine-tuning only for domain adaptation if necessary (and if provider supports) ‚Äî but RAG + prompt + instruction is usually sufficient and safer.

Training pipeline (how to add website & docs)

Crawl website pages / onboarding docs / product sheets. Use a crawler or manual upload.

Clean & chunk text (chunk size 500‚Äì1000 chars with 20% overlap).

Generate embeddings for each chunk via model embedding API.

Insert chunks into ai_embeddings with metadata (url, title, tags).

Re-run retrieval quality checks: sample queries and inspect retrieved chunks.

5 ‚Äî GHL data usage (tags, tasks, opportunities, pipeline stage)

You‚Äôll need to fetch and cache GHL data for each contact on each request. Rules:

What to fetch from GHL per contact

contact details (id, phone, name, custom fields)

tags array

open tasks (title, due_date, created_by)

opportunities / pipeline stage (amount, stage_name, last_activity_at)

locationId (for message posting)

notes and last_activities (optional)

How to present to AI

Include a short, structured JSON block before the conversation, e.g.:

GHL Contact Summary:
{
 "name": "Ravi",
 "phone": "...",
 "tags": ["trial","vip"],
 "open_tasks": [{"id":"t1","title":"Call about pricing","due":"2025-10-20"}],
 "opportunities": [{"id":"opp1","stage":"Negotiation","amount":499}]
}


Then system instructions: ‚ÄúPrioritize pipeline-stage messaging. If contact is in stage ‚ÄòNegotiation‚Äô, follow up with price + CTA.‚Äù

Sync cadence and caching

Cache contact metadata in Supabase with TTL 5‚Äì15 minutes.

On important events (pipeline changed, tag changed) GHL should call your webhook to invalidate cache.

6 ‚Äî Automations & webhooks (how actions & triggers work)

Rule: Prefer webhooks for real-time and background queue for heavy tasks.

Inbound events

WhatsApp provider ‚Üí your webhook POST /webhook/whatsapp

Validate signature

Create or find contact

Save message

Trigger AI processing job

Outbound events (from GHL)

In GHL Triggers:

On ‚ÄúNew Message (Outbound SMS)‚Äù ‚Üí point webhook to POST /webhook/ghl/outgoing-message

Payload includes contactId, message, locationId

Your server: detect if this outbound should go to Twilio (SMS) or WhatsApp (based on contact meta or organization settings)

Send via whatsappService if WhatsApp

Post result back into GHL /conversations/messages with the same message status

Suggested webhook endpoints

POST /webhook/whatsapp ‚Äî inbound messages & delivery receipts

POST /webhook/ghl/outgoing ‚Äî GHL outbound messages (triggers)

POST /webhook/ghl/events ‚Äî contact updates (tags/tasks/opportunities changed)

POST /webhook/ai/actions ‚Äî AI-generated actions (create task, update tag)

Action mapping (AI ‚Üí automation)

If AI detects intent like ‚ÄúSchedule demo‚Äù:

AI returns structured action:

{
  "action": "create_task",
  "task": {"title":"Book demo", "due":"2025-10-22", "notes":"Suggested times..."}
}


Server posts to GHL tasks API and adds note to contact; push confirmation message to user.

7 ‚Äî Option-specific rules
Option A (Custom WhatsApp channel)

Preferred channel when posting to GHL: whatsapp only if GHL's native WhatsApp is enabled for that location; otherwise use sms with meta tag.

Keep meta: { provider: 'custom_whatsapp', source: 'inbound' }

Advantages: clean channel separation; GHL UI shows WhatsApp label (if enabled).

Automations: GHL triggers on incoming whatsapp messages work normally only if channel recognized by GHL. If not, triggers will still work for sms messages.

Option B (Hijack SMS)

Post inbound WhatsApp messages as channel: "sms".

On outbound sms webhook from GHL: intercept via ghlService and send via WhatsApp instead of Twilio.

Add meta {sent_via: 'whatsapp_proxy', original_channel: 'whatsapp'} so you can filter.

Watch out: analytics & Twilio billing logic may break; maintain a small mapping layer to separate actual SMS vs proxied messages.

8 ‚Äî Security, compliance & opt-in rules

Always ensure contact has opted in to receive WhatsApp messages from you. Store opt-in timestamp.

Validate signatures of inbound webhook payloads (WhatsApp provider signature).

Encrypt API keys and service tokens; store in Cursor env or secrets manager (never in client code).

Implement rate limiting per contact to avoid WhatsApp bans (e.g., 1 message / 10s and daily caps).

Provide a human-handoff keyword (e.g., ‚Äúagent‚Äù, ‚Äúhuman‚Äù) which bypasses AI and routes to agents.

Data retention policy: expose a "forget" endpoint and follow GDPR (delete personal data when requested).

9 ‚Äî Operational rules & reliability

Use job queue (BullMQ or Supabase background workers) to process AI jobs, embedding jobs, and webhook retries.

Always ack incoming webhook with 200 before heavy processing; then push to job queue.

Idempotency: store provider message id and dedupe.

Log events for audit (who/what/when).

Monitor usage and cost of LLM calls (tokens) ‚Äî include sampling strategy: if short response, call cheaper model.

10 ‚Äî What Cursor will need you to provide (Supabase / API / auth)

When you create this project in Cursor you should have ready:

Supabase project

SUPABASE_URL

SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (server only) or anon key for client + row-level security

Postgres credentials if not using Supabase

Create necessary tables above (I can generate SQL migration in next step)

GHL credentials

GHL_API_KEY (server)

GHL_LOCATION_ID

Webhook secret if available

WhatsApp provider credentials

WHATSAPP_API_URL and WHATSAPP_API_TOKEN (Meta or chosen provider)

Webhook validation secret (for inbound requests)

AI provider

OPENAI_API_KEY or DEESEEK_API_KEY

Model preferences (embedding model, chat model)

Cursor environment & secrets

Env vars listed above set in Cursor project settings

Public URL for your server (ngrok during dev; Cursor dev URLs or deployed server for prod)

CORS rules configured for GHL webhook

Optional

Pinecone/Weaviate creds if not using Supabase vector

n8n credentials (if using n8n)

Tell Cursor to ask you for: SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, and GHL_API_KEY (server only). Do NOT put service role key in client-side.

11 ‚Äî Sample pseudocode flows (condensed)
Inbound WhatsApp webhook
app.post('/webhook/whatsapp', verifySignature, async (req,res)=>{
  res.status(200).send('ok'); // ack quickly
  const payload = req.body;
  await saveMessage(payload);
  await queue.push({type:'process_ai', messageId: savedMessage.id});
});

AI worker
jobProcessor('process_ai', async ({messageId})=>{
  const msg = await db.getMessage(messageId);
  const contact = await getOrCreateContact(msg.phone);
  const ghlMeta = await cache.getContactGHL(contact.ghl_contact_id) || await ghlService.getContactMeta(contact.ghl_contact_id);
  const shortMem = await aiService.getShortMemory(contact.id);
  const docs = await vectorDB.retrieve(msg.text, { filter: {contact_id: contact.id} , topK:5});
  const prompt = buildPrompt({ghlMeta, shortMem, docs, userMsg: msg.content});
  const aiResp = await aiService.chat(prompt, modelConfig);
  await messages.saveAssistantReply(contact.id, aiResp);
  await whatsappService.send(contact.phone, aiResp.text);
  // Optionally create GHL task if AI decided so
});

12 ‚Äî Training & continuous improvement

Daily job to crawl new website pages & docs and push embeddings.

Periodically sample AI responses to manually label and create supervised training data.

Use feedback loop: allow agents to mark AI reply as ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù; store differences as training examples.

Retain conversation logs for improvement; delete per retention policy.

13 ‚Äî Edge cases & mitigations

Duplicate events ‚Äî dedupe by provider message_id.

Media messages ‚Äî store media URL and local copy if needed; include thumbnails in AI context.

Large docs ‚Äî chunk and limit max tokens used in RAG.

Model hallucination ‚Äî add instruction: ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt know, ask to escalate or say ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not sure‚Äô.‚Äù

High traffic ‚Äî autoscale worker instances and enforce quotas.
