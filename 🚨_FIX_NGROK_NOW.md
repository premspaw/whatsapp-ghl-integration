# 🚨 URGENT: Ngrok Tunnel is OFFLINE!

## ❌ Current Error:
```
Status - 404
Error: The endpoint kathi-sensational-rosalyn.ngrok-free.dev is offline. (ERR_NGROK_3200)
```

## What Happened:
- ✅ Your Node.js server IS running (port 3000)
- ❌ Your ngrok tunnel is NOT running
- ⚠️ GHL can't reach your server without ngrok!

## 🚀 FIX THIS NOW (2 Steps):

### Step 1: Open NEW Terminal Window

**DO NOT close your current server terminal!**

1. Open **NEW PowerShell window**
2. Navigate to your project folder:
   ```powershell
   cd "D:\CREATIVE STORIES\New folder\whl to ghl"
   ```

### Step 2: Start Ngrok

**In the NEW terminal window, run:**

```powershell
ngrok http 3000
```

**Or double-click:** `START_NGROK.bat`

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Copy the NEW URL!

**You will see something like:**
```
https://XXXX-XXXX-XXXX.ngrok-free.dev
```

**Copy this URL!** (It might be different from your old one!)

---

## Step 3: Update GHL Webhook URL

### Go to Your GHL Workflow:

1. **Open GHL** → Workflows
2. **Find your workflow** (with webhook action)
3. **Click webhook action**
4. **Update URL to:**
   ```
   https://YOUR-NEW-NGROK-URL.ngrok-free.dev/api/whatsapp/send
   ```

### Example:
**Old URL (doesn't work):**
```
https://kathi-sensational-rosalyn.ngrok-free.dev/api/whatsapp/send
```

**New URL (use your new one):**
```
https://XXXX-XXXX-XXXX.ngrok-free.dev/api/whatsapp/send
                       ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑
              Your NEW ngrok URL from Step 2
```

**Make sure to add `/api/whatsapp/send` at the end!**

---

## ✅ Verify It's Working:

### Test in Browser:

**Open in Chrome:**
```
https://YOUR-NEW-NGROK-URL.ngrok-free.dev/ghl-whatsapp-tab.html
```

**You should see:**
- The WhatsApp tab interface
- No 404 error
- No "endpoint is offline" message

---

## 🎯 Complete Setup (What Should Be Running):

### Terminal 1: Node.js Server
```
> node server.js
✅ All services initialized successfully
Server running on port 3000
WhatsApp client is ready!
```
**Status: ✅ Already running**

### Terminal 2: Ngrok Tunnel (NEW!)
```
ngrok http 3000

Forwarding   https://XXXX.ngrok-free.dev -> http://localhost:3000
```
**Status: ⚠️ Need to start this NOW!**

---

## 📝 Summary of What You Need to Do:

1. **Open NEW terminal** (don't close server terminal)
2. **Run:** `ngrok http 3000`
3. **Copy the new ngrok URL** (https://XXXX.ngrok-free.dev)
4. **Update GHL webhook URL** to: `https://XXXX.ngrok-free.dev/api/whatsapp/send`
5. **Save GHL workflow**
6. **Test workflow**

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:

### Error: "ngrok is not recognized"

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Download ngrok from: https://ngrok.com/download
# Extract to a folder
# Run from that folder
cd path\to\ngrok
.\ngrok http 3000
```

### Error: "Session expired" or "Account limit reached"

**Fix:**
- Free ngrok accounts have session time limits
- You need to restart ngrok when it expires
- Consider upgrading to ngrok paid plan for stable URLs

### Ngrok URL keeps changing

**This is normal for free ngrok!**
- Every time you restart ngrok, you get a new URL
- You must update GHL webhook URL each time
- **Solution:** Use ngrok paid plan for static URLs

---

## ✅ After Ngrok is Running:

**Test the workflow again in GHL**

**You should see in server terminal:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📨 WHATSAPP SEND REQUEST RECEIVED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📞 Extracted "to": +918123133382
💬 Extracted "message": Hello PREM! Automation check
✅ WhatsApp message sent successfully
```

---

## 🎯 Quick Commands:

### Terminal 1 (Already Running):
```powershell
npm start
```

### Terminal 2 (Start Now):
```powershell
ngrok http 3000
```

**Then update GHL webhook URL with new ngrok URL!**

---

**NEXT STEP:** Open NEW terminal and run `ngrok http 3000` NOW! 🚀
